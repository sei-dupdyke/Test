# Test

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the **Test** project!

This repository is designed for experimenting with development workflows, CI/CD
pipelines, and general testing purposes. The current sample application shows
how to automate Microsoft Word via the Office interop APIs. When you run it,
Word opens and types a small letter line by line.

## Features

- Minimal setup for quick testing
- Flexible structure for adding new files or scripts
- Suitable for workflow and automation experiments
- Demonstrates automating Microsoft Word to compose a sample letter

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/test.git
   cd test
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   Ensure the [.NET 6 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) is
   installed. Running the example also requires Microsoft Word to be available on
   your machine because it uses the Office interop APIs.

3. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```
